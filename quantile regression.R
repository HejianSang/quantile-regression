#'The simulation studies were conducted to compare the performance of calibrated
#' quantile estimator to those of direct estimator and difference estimator.
#' Two finite populations of size N = 1000 were generated from bivariate
#' normal distribution respectively. The correlation between two variables in
#' the first population is 0.9 and in the second population is 0.6.
